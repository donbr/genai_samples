The script uses the `requests` library to make API calls to Arxiv.org.\\n\\nTo run this script, you will need to have Python installed on your system and replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual Arxiv API key.

The `published_at` variable is extracted from the paper\\'s metadata and converted to a Python datetime object, which is then compared to the current date minus 7 days using the `timedelta` function.

They may suggest modifications to improve the accuracy of domain identification or add new domains if necessary.\\n3. Based on the feedback from the scientist, the engineer makes revisions to the script and tests it to ensure that it correctly identifies papers in the desired domains.\\n4. Once the engineer is satisfied with the script\\'s performance, they submit it for approval to the admin.\\n5. The admin reviews the script to ensure that it meets all necessary requirements, such as accuracy, efficiency, and adherence to company policies. They may provide feedback or suggestions for improvement.\\n6. Based on the admin\\'s feedback, the engineer makes revisions to the script and resubmits it for approval. This process continues until the admin approves the final version of the script.\\n\\nIn this plan, the engineer is responsible for writing the code, while the scientist provides domain expertise to ensure that the script accurately identifies papers in various domains related to LLM applications.
